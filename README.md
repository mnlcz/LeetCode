# LeetCode

My solutions to the problems located in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).

## Csharp

The _C#_ solution uses a big `partial class` named `Solution`, each file adds a static method to that class, each one corresponds to the method provided by the LeetCode template.

Example: the solution to problem number 1 "Two Sum" will have the partial class `Solution` with the same method `TwoSum` provided by the template but static.

### Copying and pasting into LeetCode

- Copy only the method.
- Remove `static` modifier.
