## Languages

### Csharp

The _C#_ solution uses a big `static partial class` named `Solution`, each file adds a static method to that class, each one corresponds to the method provided by the LeetCode template.

Example: the solution to problem number 1 "[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)" will have the partial class `Solution` with the same method `TwoSum` provided by the template but static.

#### Copying and pasting into LeetCode

- Copy only the method.
- Remove `static` modifier.

### JavaScript

Nothing out of the ordinary, just copy and paste it. The functions have the same name, I only changed `var` and `function` to an arrow function.
